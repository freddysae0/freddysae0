# 💫 About Me:
Since I was 14 years old, I have fallen in love with the web. I started by learning **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and then moved on to creating full **PHP** pages and dynamic web applications. 🌐💻<br/>

Discovering JavaScript frameworks like **Vue** and **React** was a big leap. 🚀 Not only did they make my life easier and more efficient, but they also taught me best practices in coding, design, and security. 🛠️🔒<br/>

I spent a lot of time learning more about these frameworks and acquiring other programming skills. 📚💡<br/>

Participating in programming competitions in high school always fascinated me with the world of coding and technology. 🎓💡<br/>

Competing in events like **ICPC**, **OCI** (Cuban Computer Science Olympiad) and **USACO** (USA Computer Science Olympiad) not only improved my coding skills, but also taught me to work as a team and solve problems. 🤝  <br/>

These experiences prepared me for future challenges in the technology industry, where collaboration and innovation are key. 🌐💡<br/>

When I became an adult, I had to do a year of mandatory military service. Thank God, that service allowed me to work for a military company dedicated to selling software, where I had to do the front-end of some of their web applications. 💻🌐<br/>

I learned to work with **Vue.js**, **Vuetify**, **Git**, team management, among others. 🛠️👥<br/>

After trying many technologies, I realized that front-end development is what I like the most. 💻🚀<br/>
